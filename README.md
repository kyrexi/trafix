## üöÄ Features

- **Dynamic Test Case Generation**: Automatically create test cases based on provided API details.
- **Interactive Frontend**: A clean and responsive interface for managing test cases and viewing results.
- **Test Case Customization**: Edit, delete, or add new test cases seamlessly.
- **Execution and Results Display**: Execute test cases and review structured results, including status codes, response bodies, and execution times.
- **[Orchestration using Kestra](https://github.com/prnvtripathi/apilux/blob/master/backend/kestra_flow.yml)**: Robust orchestration of test workflows using Kestra for scalability and fault tolerance.

## üîÑ Frontend Workflow

### **1. User Interaction**
1. **API Information Form**:
   - Input fields for:
     - Endpoint URL
     - HTTP Method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
     - Headers (optional)
     - Payload/Body (for POST/PUT requests)

2. **Generated Test Cases Display**:
   - View autogenerated test cases, such as boundary tests and response validation tests.

3. **Edit Test Cases**:
   - Modify, delete, or add new test cases.

4. **Execute Test Cases**:
   - Click a button to execute all test cases.

5. **View Results**:
   - Results displayed in a table format with:
     - Test case name
     - Status code
     - Response body
     - Execution time

## üîß Backend Workflow

### **1. Test Case Management**
- **Receiving API Info**: API details are received from the frontend via the Go backend.
- **Generating Test Cases**:
  - Predefined logic or AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI) create diverse test cases.
  - Test cases are stored in a MongoDB database.

### **2. Test Case Execution**
- **Execution Trigger**: A Kestra workflow is initiated with test case details.
- **Execution and Storage**:
  - Test cases are executed, and results are stored in MongoDB.
  - Results include response details like status codes and execution times.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Kestra Workflow

APILUX utilizes **Kestra** for orchestrating test execution workflows. The Kestra workflow manages the lifecycle of test cases, ensuring scalability, reliability, and streamlined operation.

### **Workflow Steps**
1. **Fetch Test Cases**: Retrieve stored test cases from MongoDB.
2. **Execute Tests**: Use Kestra's HTTP tasks to run API requests.
3. **Store Results**: Save execution results, including response details and performance metrics.
4. **Notify Frontend**: Update the frontend with completion status using a WebSocket or HTTP endpoint.

<!-- ### **Example Workflow**
The Kestra workflow file is available in the `kestra-workflows/` directory. See the [workflow documentation](#kestra-workflow) for details on setup and usage. -->

## üìÇ Backend Test Case Generation

1. **Receive API Info**:
   - Endpoint: `/api/generate-test-cases`
   - Input: API details (URL, method, headers, payload)
   - Validation: Ensure required fields are provided.

2. **Generate Test Cases**:
   - **Happy Path Tests**: Valid inputs expected to succeed.
   - **Negative Tests**: Invalid inputs (e.g., wrong data types, missing fields).
   - **Boundary Tests**: Edge cases for parameters.
   - **Performance Tests**: High payload or frequent requests.

3. **Store Test Cases**:
   - Save test cases in the `test_cases` collection in MongoDB.

4. **Execute Test Cases**:
   - Endpoint: `/api/execute-test-cases`
   - Trigger Kestra workflows for test execution.
